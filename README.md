# 🚗 RapidoDriverSimulation  

### 🗺️ iOS Driver Movement Simulation with CoreLocation & MapKit  

RapidoDriverSimulation is an iOS application that simulates a driver moving from one location to another on a map. It utilizes **MapKit/Google Maps**, **CoreLocation**, and **animation** to visualize the driver's journey along a predefined route.  

## 📌 Features  

### 🗺️ Map Display  
- Displays a **map centered** around the user's current location.  
- Draws a **polyline route** between two points.  

### 🚖 Driver Movement Simulation  
- Animates a driver moving smoothly along the predefined route.  
- Movement is **updated every second** and completes within **30 seconds**.  
- The map automatically tracks the driver's position.  

### 📍 Core Location  
- Uses **mock location data** to simulate real-time movement.  
- Updates driver's position using `CLLocationCoordinate2D`.  

### 🎛️ User Interaction  
- **Start button** to begin the simulation.  
- Supports **zooming, panning, and rotating** the map.  

### 🏗️ Architecture  
- Implements **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for better separation of concerns.  
- Clean and scalable **Swift code following best practices**.  

## 🚀 Tech Stack  

- **Swift**  
- **MapKit / Google Maps SDK**  
- **CoreLocation**  
- **UIKit**  
- **MVVM Architecture**  

## 🛠 Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RapidoDriverSimulation.git
   cd RapidoDriverSimulation
   ```
2. Open the project in **Xcode**.  
3. Install dependencies (if using Google Maps, run `pod install`).  
4. Run the app on a **simulator or real device**.  

## 🧪 Unit Testing  

- Includes **unit tests** to validate movement logic and coordinate updates.  
- Ensures **smooth driver animation and polyline rendering**.
